# Wallplayper
Live wallpapers for ChromeOS devices (even managed enterprise or education ones)
Supports video files and web based wallpapers in the Lively Wallpaper's zip format.

it's functional i guess but it's vibecoded slop and is such a waste of water, electricity, and datacenter resources

# Explanation
A few years ago as a passtime while I was bored in school I decided I wanted to code something and with my limited HTML and CSS knowledge (and a little bit of Google Sites for the UI) I made a live wallpaper solution that pretty much "ran" on any ChromeOS device, even if it was managed. [You can check out the original project here.](https://github.com/krnelpan1c/livelywallpaper-chromeos)

While it was cool at the time, it was pretty limited, static, and the end user had no choice in what to select their wallpaper as apart from the ones I manually added. I've been curious about these AI coding tools like Cursor and Google Antigravity so I decided to give Antigravity a try as someone who doesn't actually know how to develop apps apart from static HTML/CSS and have a basic understanding of code snippets. While I was able to get something functional, it feels very limiting compared to figuring it out myself and writing the code manually. In the right hands, AI tools could potentially help accelerate some workflows but it probably (or at least shouldn't) replace developers outright due to the nature of these models as they just regurgitate existing information. (we can see the consequences of this in real-time with what's going on with Windows 11 these days.)
